## Problem Statement

### -Lack of platform to share cat’s daily routine among cat owners.  
Despite the growing number of pet owners, especially cat owners, there is currently no centralized platform for individuals to share and celebrate their daily routines and experiences with their cats. This results in missed opportunities to connect, learn, and bond over a shared passion for cat companions. 

### -Limited source of expert advice since the information regarding the cat issues is not centralized. 
Not all members of the pet owner community possess the necessary knowledge and expertise to provide optimal care for their cats. This knowledge gap can lead to health and well-being concerns for cats and owners alike. An accessible source of information and expert advice is essential to address this issue. 

### -It is time-consuming to report and find the missing cat. 
As cats are known for their active and independent nature, there has been a notable increase in missing cat cases over the years. These cases cause distress for owners and the cats themselves. A platform that can facilitate the urgent reporting of missing cats and the mobilization of nearby cat enthusiasts for assistance is needed to address this problem.

Through the expert services provided, it aims to empower the cat’s owner knowledge about their feline companions. 

### -To Lessen the Issue of Missing Cats

### Database Used
   Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) is like a big organized filing cabinet for data. It's putting information in tables and using specific keys to communicate it. Each table looks like a grid with rows and columns, which is quite similar to the spreadsheet. Each column is an individual piece of information, and each row contains a specific detail about it. These special keys make it easier to keep everything organized and to make sure that each piece of information is properly linked. MSSQL helps to quickly find the data, ensures it is accurate and allows you to display them in many different ways. In order to ensure that any changes to the data are correct, some tasks are also performed automatically. This system ensures that the information remains clean and error free, making it easier for people to work with their data safely and effectively.
